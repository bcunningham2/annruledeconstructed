                            <p>Re: Cunningham v. State of Oregon et al., Marion County Circuit Court, No. 12C 16124 Ann Rule Deconstructed (ARD) had its first breath of life June 2009. Over the following two years, until it was completed, ARD struggled to survive. When the Oregon Department of Corrections (ODOC) became aware of the content of ARD they relentlessly tried to prevent its completion.</p>
                            
                            <p>Despite these obstacles I completed the book which I now refer to as Prison Version 1.1. It was a challenge to get a copy of the manuscript out of the penitentiary. It became necessary to file a civil lawsuit in an effort to complete and transfer my work. It has always been and is still a pitched battle.</p>
                            
                            <p>'Friends' of the ODOC are embarrassingly exposed in ARD. These 'friends' include Ann Rule and they do not want this book published. ARD also examines the long-prevalent political corruption of the Oregon criminal justice system. Our elected judges are wholly beholden to the wealthy and influential members of our community who are needed to contribute to their (re-)election campaigns. ARD needed to be written.</p>
                            
                            <p>In its present unedited format ARD is a brutally honest depiction of the truth. Granted you have to be open-minded to read it, but it is a valued source of information. It also provides a glimpse of the exculpatory evidence the State police destroyed or hid from my criminal defense, and it is a treatise of why and who killed CHERYL KEETON Cunningham. It also explains why Ann Rule et al. and the State of Oregon want me to die in prison.</p>

                            "I found ARD offered a lot of insight into the unreasonable and deliberate manipulation of the facts by Ann Rule who took the liberty to call her story a true story... It also gives the reader a peek into the corrupt justice system and the criminals who control the system. Brad Cunningham gave intimate details of his relationships and the love for the women in his life, showing that he was not the controlling, manipulating or jealous man that Ann Rule wants you to believe. Ann Rule did not just pick Mr. Cunningham for her twisted take she went much further by inserting herself into his life and using her influences with the justice system to further cause harm to both he and his children. When you profit from death as Ann Rule does you are a crook in the worst way and that should be a crime."
