                        <p>Ann Rule permanently harmed my family, especially my children, with her work of fiction, <em>Dead by Sunset.</em> The injury she inflicted upon them was irreparable and harsh.</p>
                        
                        <p>She has also caused delay and harm to my criminal appeals, and her adverse influences continue today. I am <em>absolutely innocent</em> of Cheryl's murder. (See Addenda.) Ann Rule Deconstructed (ARD) details the mistakes and falsehoods in <em>Dead by Sunset.</em> ARD provides the truth, which often is more interesting than the made-up story in Dead by Sunset.</p>
                        
                        <p>What I have done is given you the actual events and personalities of the women who were in my life and the DBS book. Ann Rule Deconstructed will offend some readers. It will make others feel uncomfortable. In telling the whole truth the entire story was necessary. The reader must know and understand how complex my relationships were with the women in my life.</p>
